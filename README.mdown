# Metadata Plugin for CakePHP 2.0+

Metadata provides storage of arbitrary n-deep arrays of data related to a particular model record

## Installation

* Clone/Copy the files in this directory into `app/plugins/metadata`
* Include the metadata behavior in the models you wish to have metadata:
		var $actsAs = array('Metadata.Metadata' => array(
			'validate' => array(
				'fieldName'	=> array(
					'rule'		=> 'postal',
					'message'	=> 'Must be valid postal code',
				),
				'some' => array(
					'nested' => array(
						'array'	=> array(
							array(
								'rule'		=> 'numeric',
								'message'	=> 'Must be numeric'
							),
							array(
								'rule'		=> array(
									'decimal',
									2
								),
								'message'	=> 'Must be decimal'
							)
						)
					)
				)
			)
		));

* Define any validation rules that you need, in a similar fashion to model validation rules (all the built-in Validator rules work).  Multiple rules per node are supported, and nodes can be as deep as required.
